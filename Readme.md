#GrooveFish

I made this project for my friend clement, who could not get over the end of grooveshark.

Basically, this is a youtube backed playlist generator.

You connect with a google account, and then search through youtube music library. You can then play your whole Playlist.

This is a nodeJS server backed by a MongoDB Database.

You have to put in some google App credential for user authentification.
